        We will NEVER sell or rent your data including any of your contact’ data. Nor do we claim any ownership rights
        over any content you provide to us which shall remain 100% yours.
        We may use or share your data where it is necessary to complete a transaction, to operate or improve the
        Services, to do something that you have asked us to do, or tell you of products and services that we think may
        be of interest. By requesting us to provide the Services to you, you consent to us using such personal data as
        may be necessary to do so, including the use of mobile phone numbers provided by you to facilitate sending and
        receiving of text messages, and you warrant that you are authorised to share such personal data with us.
        If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you by electronic means (email or SMS) with information
        about goods and services similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale or negotiations of a sale to
        you. If you are a new customer, and where we permit selected third parties to use your data, we (or they) will
        contact you by electronic means only if you have consented to this. If you do not want us to use your data in
        this way, or to pass your details on to third parties for marketing purposes, please put a check mark in the
        relevant box which can be found on the form on which we collect your data.
        How we will use the information we collect about you:
        To administer our Site and for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research,
        statistical and survey purposes.
        To improve our Site to ensure that content is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your
        computer.
        To allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so.
        As part of our efforts to keep our Site safe and secure.
        To measure or understand the effectiveness of advertising we serve to you and others, and to deliver relevant
        advertising to you.
        To make suggestions and recommendations to you and other users of our site about goods or services that may
        interest you or them.
        Where you are contacted with an offer or service based on information you have shared with us, we will provide
        you with an opportunity to opt-out of receiving such further communications at the time you are contacted.
        However, in connection with any Services you request (for which you have paid a fee), we reserve the right to
        send you certain communications relating to those Services, such as service announcements, and administrative
        messages, that are considered part of your Matthew621.net account, without offering you the opportunity to
        opt-out of receiving them.
        We may share data about you when:
        Required by any regulatory bodies to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations.
        Operating our business, as necessary, with our service providers, contractors and vendors.
        Responding to court orders, or legal process, to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal
        claims and if in our judgement in such circumstances disclosure is required or appropriate.
        Necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, harm or threats
        of harm to any person or property of Matthew621.net or violations of our Terms of Service or policies.
        As we continue to develop our business, we may also buy or sell all or part of our business. In such
        transactions, data you have shared with us is generally one of the business assets that will be transferred, and
        you hereby consent to such transfer.
        <h2>Data Transfer</h2>
        In order to provide the Services you request, it may be necessary for your data to be transferred to and stored
        by mobile network operators, telecommunications providers or other organisations in countries outside America
        (“the US”). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the US who work for us or for one of our
        suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of
        your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this
        transfer, storing and processing. Matthew621.net will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your
        data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. These countries may not have similar data
        protection laws to the US and we offer no assurances that your data will be protected as set out in this policy.
        All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted
        using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access
        certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share
        your password with anyone.
        Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do
        our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site;
        any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information , we will use strict procedures and
        security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
        <h2>Confidentiality and Security</h2>
        Security for all personally-identifiable information (including all cell phone numbers, texts, messages and
        other data) is our priority. However, no data transmissions can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently,
        we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
        Once we receive your information, we take reasonable measures to secure it on our systems and do so in
        accordance with our Security Policy.

       <h2>Matthew621.net Commitment & Responsibilities</h2> 
        Matthew621.net is committed to robust data protection and will ensure that:
        <ul>
        <li> There is a designated data protection officer at all times with specific responsibility for data protection.</li>
          <li> Everyone managing and handling personal information understands that they are contractually responsible for

        <h2>Updating and Retaining your Data</h2>
        
        All your personal data and account information may be updated at any time. Most information provided to us is
        entirely optional. We shall retain data and information in our records for no longer than is necessary for us to
        provide the Services and to the extent necessary for our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
        Under existing law, all persons have the legal right to see a copy of the personal data we hold about them. This
        shall be subject to a payment of a fee of $25. So that we may comply with your request, you must provide us with
